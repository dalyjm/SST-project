# SST-project
Jess Daly seatrout project data

My project examines the physiological relationship between myxospore density in the muscle tissue and swimming performance. A suite of physiological parameters, including hematoctit/ hemoglobin/ lactate/ glucose/ CS/ LDH, are being examined to attempt to identify the reason that the spore density affects swimming. In my R project I run statistical tests on, and graph, several relationships of interest to examine potential effects.

My data, uploaded as SSTdata.csv, is entirely randomly simulated in R. I do expect to see relationships between many of the parameters I investigated when I actually complete my trials, but because of how this data was generated there is very little in terms of discernable patterns or significant results. 

Code is uploaded as a .Rmd file and should be run in the order it has been written. I have written very basic descriptions of what I've done above each chunk of code to hopefully prevent confusion during recreation. However it should be noted that the first chunk of code is the generation of the random data, and if another person runs the same code they will get different numbers and therefore different results/graphs farther down the line.

I would like to thank Dan McGlinn and Juliane Caughron for their help and advice in creating and troubleshooting this code.
